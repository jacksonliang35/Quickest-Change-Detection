### Covid-19 Monitoring Application

![COVID-19 monitoring example](./mct_covid.png)

The upper subplot is the three-day moving average of the new cases  of COVID-19 as a fraction of the population in Wayne County, MI (left), St. Louis County, MO (middle), and Hamilton County, OH (right). The x-axis is the number days elapsed after January 21, 2020. The pre-change mean and variance are estimated using data from days 120 to 150. The FAR threshold alpha is set to 0.01, meaning an average of 1 false alarm every 100 observations (days). For each county, the mean-threshold (in green) is set to be 3.3 times of the estimated pre-change mean (in cyan). The lower subplot shows the evolution of the statistic in the corresponding county.
